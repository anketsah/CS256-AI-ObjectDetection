# CS256-AI-Human and Object Detection

## Project Summary
The primary objective of our project was to improve human and object detection on low-light/dark images. We've used [EnlightenGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06972) and have also used EnlightenGAN with different combinations of image filters such as Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and Unsharp Mask (USM) to enhance low-light/dark images. The model that we used for human and object detection on these enlightened images was [Faster R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497) and found significant improvement in the performance. For more details, please refer to the [project report](https://github.com/ksheeraj/CS256-AI-ObjectDetection/blob/master/CS256_ProjectReport.pdf).

## Architecture Diagrams

Based on this diagram, we are running inference on low-light/dark images, taken from the Exclusively Dark dataset, using the Faster R-CNN model from Detectron2. **The intent of this experiment is to examine how Faster R-CNN performs on a low-light/dark image.**

Based on this diagram, we are feeding in a few low-light/dark images into EnlightenGAN and then feeding in the fake images generated by EnlightenGAN into the same Faster R-CNN model as the one used in Architecture Diagram 1. **The intent of this experiment is to examine how Faster R-CNN performs on enlightened/enhanced images.**

Based on this diagram, we are feeding in a few low-light/dark images into an image filter, called CLAHE. This filter will. Then the image outputs of this filter will be fed into the same Faster R-CNN model that we have been using thus far. **The intent of this experiment is to examine how Faster R-CNN performs on low-light/dark images that have been fed through an image filter.**

As showcased in this diagram, the first two steps are a subset of Architecture Diagram 3. For this experiment, we will be taking the output images produced by the CLAHE filter and feed it through EnlightenGAN. Since EnlightenGAN adds noise to its output images, we feed the output images from EnlightenGAN into the CLAHE filter to filter out the noise. Then the output images from the CLAHE filter are fed into the Faster R-CNN model that we have been working with so far. **The intent of this experiment is to examine how Faster R-CNN performs on images that have been applied with a combination of image filters an EnlightenGAN.**
